App consists of controllers and DAOs. There is a simple hierarchy for CRUD methods in father classes(BaseDAO,BaseController).

DAOs work with hibernate sessions, execute SQL queries needed for methods.

Controller objects proceed http requests and handle data to DAOs.

The same hierarchy stands for DB entities.
